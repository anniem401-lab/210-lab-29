// A function defined to simulate a factory changing each production cycle
// Parameters: map of departments, number of intervals
// Void function to simulate factory

// Define main function
// Initialize a map to store factory information stored in an array of lists for:
// ingredients, cookie batches, and employees

int main (){
// main program 

// Open an external file to read data about the facotry and popoulate the map
// If file doesn't open, output error and close out.
// Else: Ingredients, cookies, and employees are read from each line.

// Close file

// Time-based simulation for factory starts
// For 25 intervals, interate through each department in the map and simulate changes
// Random events impact the factory:
// Hired worker, new cookie batches, change in stock, cookies packed
