Project overview:
This project simulates the operation of a cookie factory over 25 time periods. 
Each time period a cycle of cookies being baked, stored, and sold. 
The program will keep track of the baking, packaging, and the selling of cookies.

Implementation:
An std::map will be used to represent different departments in the cookie factory. 
The key will be the department name. We will have a list for ingredients, 
cookie batches, and employees which define the map value with an array of lists.

Simulated events:
The random events may include baking new batches, consumption of ingredients/updating 
stock, and packed cookies for sale for each production cycle.
